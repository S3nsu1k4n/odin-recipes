The Odin Project: Recipes 

## Introduction
In this project, I am going to build a basic recipe website to practice some basic HTML knowledge I have acquired. 

The website will consist of a main index page which will have links to a few recipes. The website wonâ€™t look very pretty and will be a more of a brutalist web design.

## Demonstrated skills

- basic git
- basic html
